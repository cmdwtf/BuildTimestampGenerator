# üõ†‚è≤ BuildTimestampGenerator
Have you wanted a way to reliably get the time your application was compiled at, but still wanted to have 'deterministic' builds enabled? Well then do I have the package for you!

This is a small Roslyn source generator that outputs a class, `BuildTimestamp`, that contains several variables that describe when the source generator was run (and thus when your project was built.)

## ‚ùìUsage

- Reference the source generator (sometimes called 'analyzer') in your `.csproj` 
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="cmdwtf.BuildTimestampGenerator" Version="*" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>
```
- Build once so packages are restored and source can be generated.
- Use the properties of the class `cmdwtf.BuildTimestamp` to determine your compile time!

### ‚ùóExample

#### üì•Source

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloTimestamp
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"I was built at {cmdwtf.BuildTimestamp.BuildTime}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### üì§Output

```
I was built at 1/27/2022 12:54:21 PM
```

(Obviously, your output will vary.)
