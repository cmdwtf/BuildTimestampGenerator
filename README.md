# üõ†‚è≤ BuildTimestampGenerator
A small source generator that outputs a class, `BuildTimestamp`, that contains several variables that describe when the source generator was run (and thus when your project was built.)

## ‚ùìUsage

- Reference the source generator (sometimes called 'analyzer') in your `.csproj` 
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="cmdwtf.BuildTimestampGenerator" Version="*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```
- Build once so packages are restored.
- Use the properties of the class `cmdwtf.BuildTimestampGenerator` to determine your comile time!

### ‚ùóExample

```csharp

```
